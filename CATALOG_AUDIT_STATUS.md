# CarbCalc UA — Catalog Audit Registry

Updated: 2026-09-14
Branch: `dev-large-update`

GitHub is the source of truth. Workflow: `Zakaz.ua discovery → existing-catalog gap check → nutrition verification → pending review → dedup → explicit runtime whitelist → merge → parse/test → APK`.

## Mandatory catalog identity rule

CarbCalc UA uses a hybrid generic + branded model. Simple/raw foods are generic-first and deduplicated across brands. Manufactured/recipe-dependent foods may coexist when verified nutrition materially differs or recipe/subtype is distinct. Same recipe with different package sizes should be one identity where practical. Before every new SKU, check `assets/products.json`. Never invent missing P/F/C; conflicting or incomplete data stays outside runtime.

## Workstream registry

| Workstream | Status | Checkpoint |
|---|---|---|
| Рудь | CLOSED | Runtime integrated and device-tested. |
| Danone | SKIPPED | Reopen only for a useful missing group. |
| Крупи та бобові | CLOSED CHECKPOINT | Runtime integrated; unresolved conflicts excluded. |
| Хліб та випічка | CLOSED CHECKPOINT | Runtime integrated. |
| Макаронні вироби | CLOSED AUDIT CHECKPOINT | Runtime whitelist validation still required. |
| Пластівці та сухі сніданки | CLOSED AUDIT CHECKPOINT | Runtime whitelist validation still required. |
| Продукти швидкого приготування | CLOSED AUDIT CHECKPOINT | Dry-basis rule mandatory; runtime whitelist validation still required. |
| Солодощі | CLOSED AUDIT CHECKPOINT | Some earlier parts require revalidation before runtime. |
| Снеки | CLOSED AUDIT CHECKPOINT | Revalidate part5/part12 and verify part9/10/11 before runtime. |
| Соуси | CLOSED + RUNTIME CHECKPOINT | 8 explicitly whitelisted verified ketchup products integrated. Existing Torchin runtime block preserved and not duplicated. |
| Консерви | NEXT | Next catalog category. |

## Sauces runtime checkpoint

Audit checkpoint: `assets/sauces_checkpoint.json`.
Runtime whitelist: `assets/zakaz_sauces_runtime_verified.json`.
Whitelist commit: `4fdadb009977e6cdf87592dad0f5e93161e44ccf`.
Merge-script commit: `13211d27d99b78f35d589b553357ba6ffa373350`.
Generated runtime commit: `c5a784ece1de2b1e7f15a99447ebc92259fa414d`.
Merge workflow `Merge verified catalogs #110` completed successfully.

Integrated sauce whitelist contains 8 verified ketchup products from Heinz, Щедро and Чумак. Audit-only sauce files remain separate. Conflicting Torchin retailer values were not used to overwrite existing runtime products.

## APK/runtime checkpoint

APK **#233** is the current USER-TESTED STABLE Android checkpoint.
- run ID `34860877221`
- head `7be9e02ab0f21caba4f247f4658eb1529edf72b3`
- artifact `CarbCalcUA-0.6.0-build-233`
- analyze/tests/release build/publish all succeeded
- user Android test on 2026-09-14 confirmed product-selection navigation works correctly
- remaining UI follow-up: final `Додати до щоденника` button needs bottom safe-area/scroll clearance so it cannot be obscured by app or Android navigation.

APK **#224** is the previous USER-TESTED stable checkpoint. APK #226 was tested but its navigation fix was incomplete.

## Planned category sequence

Next: **консерви → напої → заморожені напівфабрикати**.

## Persistence rule

On a new chat, read `PROJECT_STATUS.md` and this file first. Before runtime merge always use: verify → dedup → explicit whitelist → merge → full validation → APK.
